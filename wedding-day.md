# Attire

There are no restrictions or requests on what you should or should not wear;
please feel free to wear traditional dress or anything else you wish.  Most
wedding guests in Latvia choose to wear semiformal clothing - suits and dresses.

In the following morning for brunch the same applies - wear what you like. For
reference, we will be dressed smart-casual.

In September the temperature is likely to be around 12 degrees celcius (55
farenheit), and rain is unpredictable.  We suggest to bring a light jacket.


# Traditions and Gifts

It is a Latvian tradition to congratulate the couple after the wedding ceremony
by gifting flowers.  The choice of gifting flowers at our wedding is white
lysanthius.  These flowers will be available at the Manor for you to collect
prior to the ceremony.

Your presence at our wedding is all that we wish for. However if you want to
give a gift, we will be grateful to receive a small cash donation towards our
honeymoon.
