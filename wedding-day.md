# Attire

Semi-formal (suits and appropriate dresses).

The wedding's color scheme is greens and whites.

The groom will wear a navy tuxedo.

In September the temperature is likely to be around 12 degrees celcius (55
farenheit), and rain is unpredictable.  We suggest to bring a light jacket.

# Formalities

Latvian tradition is to bring flowers to the newlywed couple on the day of the
wedding.  On the wedding day, the wedding organisers will give guests each a
flower to bring.

We kindly ask that guests do not bring gifts.  We are not using a wedding
registry.  If you would like to contribute towards a honeymoon, please speak to
xyz.
