Travelling to Riga, Latvia
==========================

Riga is the Capital and the largest city of Latvia, and home to its only
Airport. We suggesting using [skyscanner.com](http://skyscanner.com) to search
for flights to and from Latvia. We are happy to help you find your tickets, so
please feel free to contact us.

Travelling from the United States
---------------------------------

We suggest booking tickets at least six months in advance. We usually choose to
fly by Finnair, Norwegian Airlines, or Scandinavian Airlines, and their partners
Air Baltic when travelling to and from the US. There are many more options, but
we suggest avoiding Aeroflot airlines, to avoid a layover in the crowded Moscow
airport.

Since Latvia is a party to the Schengen Agreement, Americans do not need a visa
to travel to Latvia, and stay there for up to ninety days. Please see the page
below if you wish to familiarize yourself with some useful travel information:

Travelling from the United Kingdom and other European countries
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you are travelling to Riga from the United Kingdom we strongly suggest
flying. We suggest direct flights, since there are many inexpensive options.
There are direct flights to Riga from London, Glasgow, and other major cities,
and are usually operated by Ryanair. Another good option, if you are travelling
from Edinburgh, is Norwegian Airlines - however, a transfer in Oslo is usually
part of their journey to Latvia.

If you are travelling from any other European country, we suggest looking at
[airbaltic.com](http://airbaltic.com), as they have direct flights from many
European cities, including Prague and Vilnius.
