Travelling to Riga, Latvia
==========================

Riga is the Capital and the largest city of Latvia, and home to its only
Airport. We suggesting using [skyscanner.com](http://skyscanner.com) to search
for flights to and from Latvia. We are happy to help you find your tickets, so
please feel free to contact us.

Travelling from the United States
---------------------------------

We suggest booking tickets at least six months in advance. We usually choose to
fly by Finnair, Norwegian Airlines, or Scandinavian Airlines when travelling to
and from the US. There are many more options, but we suggest avoiding Aeroflot
airlines, to avoid a layover in the crowded Moscow airport.

Since Latvia is a party to the Schengen Agreement, Americans do not need a visa
to travel to Latvia, and stay there for up to ninety days. The page below may be
useful to familiarize yourself with some useful travel information:

Travelling from the United Kingdom and other European countries
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you are travelling to Riga from the United Kingdom we suggest flying. Ryanair
and Norwegian Airlines provide some good options.

If you are travelling from any other European country, we suggest checking
[airbaltic.com](http://airbaltic.com) who have direct flights from many European
cities such as Prague, Paris, and Vilnius.
