Accommodation in Riga, Latvia
=============================

Accommodation for all guests on the evening of the wedding will be organized at
the reception location. Please let us know in advance if you have a preference
for the room (double, twin, single, family), and we will arrange the best option
for you. If you wish to travel to Latvia a few days before the wedding, or stay
longer after the wedding, there are many options including hotels, hostels, and
guest-houses.

We recommend considering a hotel in Riga city center, as that will allow you to
explore the city by foot, and gives easy access to transportation if you wish to
travel outside the capital. We suggest considering the options on
[booking.com](http://booking.com). Feel free to ask us if you have any questions
- we will try to help. As a rough estimate, the prices for a five star hotel
range from 200 to 220 euros per night; for a four star, from 40 to 140 euros per
night; and for a three star, 30 to 70 euros per night.

If you would prefer to spend your evenings away from the crowds, and stay near
the beach, we suggest considering Jurmala. It is close to Riga - approximately
25 minutes - and the boardwalk and beaches here are a popular attraction for
tourists.

Outside the center of Riga, public transportation is less accessible. However,
taxis are fairly inexpensive.
