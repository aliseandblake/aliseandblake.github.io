Accommodation to Riga, Latvia
==========================

We will organize the accommodation on our wedding night, so no need to worry
about that. Everyone will be accommodated in Bershas or at nearby hotel. Please
let us know in advance if you have a preference for the room (double, twin,
single, family) , and we will arrange the best option for you. However, if you
wish to travel to Latvia a few days before the wedding or stay longer after the
wedding, there are many options including hotels, hostels and guesthouses.

We strongly recommend opting for a hotel in Riga city center, as that will allow
you  to explore the city and give easy access to transportation if you wish to
travel  outside the capital.  We suggest you check the options on booking.com,
and ask us if  you have a question about certain property, we will try to help.
Just to give a rough estimate, the prices for a 5* hotel range from 200 to 220
euros  per night, for a 4* from 40 to 140 Euros per night,  and for a 3* hotel
30 to 70 euros  per night.

However, if you would like to be away from the crowds and stay near the beach,
the  resort city Jurmala is a good option. Itâ€™s close proximity to Riga
(approx.. 25  minutes) is an advantage, and this beautiful city is a top
destination for most  tourists.
